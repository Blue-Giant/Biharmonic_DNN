# Biharmonic_DNN
This a DNN frameworks for solving biharmonic equations.  DNN_base, DNN_data, DNN_tools, plotData nad saveData are the key modules for our work, they are the basic modules.

1.DNN_base file includes the definitions of activation functions and the model of networks, as well as some initialize methods of weigth and bias.
