# Biharmonic_DNN
This a DNN frameworks for solving biharmonic equations.  

0. DNN_base, DNN_data, DNN_tools, plotData nad saveData are the key modules for our work, they are the basic modules. If you have other operations, you can add yourself functions into these modules.

1.DNN_base file includes the definitions of activation functions and the model of networks, as well as some initialize methods of weight and bias. 

2. DNN_bounadary file includes some functions for dealing with the boudaries of PDE_DNN networks.

3. How to use these basic modules? Please refer to any implementation for Biharmonic reuations with Dirichlet or Navier boundary.
